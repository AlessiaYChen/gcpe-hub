<!-- Contextual Help Content Section -->
<p>This section describes <b>when</b> an activity may be planned (or when it is most likely to occur, for third-party events). This information is used to produce the look-ahead and enable strategic planning.</p>

<p class="helpFieldTitle">Start and End Times</p>
    When left to default (8am to 6pm), it will show as "Time TBD" if the activity is not confirmed (and only lasts one day).
<p>

<!-- <p class="helpFieldTitle">Date (Time) Confirmed</p>
    If the start and end date are the same, only the time needs to be confirmed.
<p>-->

<p class="helpFieldTitle">Potential Dates</p>
   This is used to convey when an activity will occur in a general sense (e.g: summer, fall) which is mainly used to support the 30/60/90 report. The Potential dates field should be cleared when an activity is narrowed down. Please ensure it aligns with the start and end date, and use the scheduling considerations field for any further considerations.
<p>

<p class="helpFieldTitle">Scheduling Considerations</p>
<p>
    If the event is planned for a specific date and time, please explain <b>why</b>. Also advise whether the timing is affected by, or dependent upon, other related activities.
    <br />
    If the event is not planned for a specific date and time it is assumed that scheduling is flexible and can be changed if necessary.
    <br />
    If the event is simply an all-day “awareness” type of activity, it is understood that scheduling is not required.
</p>

<!--Schedule – advises what date and time activity is being planned, considered or preferred; and if it is confirmed.
Start Date & End Date	Select the planned date, or expected date range during which the activity may occur (report or policy review being released). Once solidified, update to confirmed date.
Start Time & End Time	Leave as default until planned time. Once solidified, and confirmed with HQ, update to the expected and/or confirmed date.
All day Activity	Use this for Awareness Days/Weeks/Month.  Releases or events occurring during these should be entered separately with the specific day and time of the release.
Date Confirmed?	Default remains as unconfirmed until updated by user.  Ensure Start and End dates are accurate prior to selecting Date confirmed. Note: if same day event, this becomes time confirmed.

Time Confirmed?	For releases, IBs etc., once the date is confirmed, select the Confirmed radio button, only once it has been confirmed by HQ / Writing Group.-->
